编程设计语言概论
HW2 is comprised of multiple math based functions and coroutines.
HW3 is a lexer that takes different strings and returns the category of each character in the returned lexeme string.
HW4 is a parser that interprets the lexeme string returned by HW3.
HW5 is comprised of multiple functions using recursion and lists in Haskell.
HW6 is an interpreter that combines lexit.lua and parseit.lua from HW3 and HW4 and creates code specific to the Jerboa language.
HW7 encompasses four different programming languages; Jerboa, Forth, Scheme, and Prolog. The programs consist of one main function each that performs arithmetic on lists and numbers.
